# dtx-submit-claims

THIS SCRIPT SHOULD BE REDUNDANT NOW AS DTX WAS UPDATED

This is a TamperMonkey script (a browser extension) which alters the code for the web DTX submit claims tab so it will work properly in Chrome. (Only IE is officially supported)

# Set up
Install the TamperMonkey extension on Chrome or Firefox..\
[Chrome Install](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)\
[Firefox Install](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)

With the extension installed, right click [this link](https://github.com/martin-armstrong/dtx-submit-claims/raw/master/DTX_SUBMIT_CLAIMS.user.js) and choose open in new tab.\
You should be prompted to install the script into TamperMonkey.

Once installed, click the TamperMonkey symbol in the top right of your browser then click "Dashboard".\
This will open a new tab showing a list of installed scripts, check the DTX_SUBMIT_CLAIMS script is installed and enabled.

With this script activated you should now be able to use the submit claims tab in DTX as normal.
